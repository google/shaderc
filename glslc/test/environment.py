"""Classes for conveniently specifying a test environment.

These classes have write() methods that create objects in a test's environment.
For instance, File creates a file, and Directory creates a directory with some
files or subdirectories in it.

Example:
  test.environment = Directory('.', [
    File('a.vert', 'void main(){}'),
    Directory('subdir', [
      File('b', 'b content'),
      File('c', 'c content')
    ])
  ])

In general, these classes don't clean up the disk content they create.  They
were written in a test framework that handles clean-up at a higher level.
